## watch-dog-next

This webapp is build on Next.js and React. It is meant to be deployed alongside the [backend](https://github.com/jonreesman/watch-dog-kafka), and will not display data without it. Presently it is hard-coded to my own backend, however, I can not guarantee that I will leave that up.

To deploy the development server, simply run:
```yarn dev```
